Primary:   
Jeffrey Edward Epstein b 1953 has one brother Mark, mother, Paula. Member of the Trilateral Commission and CFR. He was born in Brooklyn graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969\. Attended Cooper Union two years for physics. 1974-1975 JE taught Dalton School (sexually abused minors while a teacher?) and N.Y.U. Was a private tutor for a Dalton student, the son of Bear Stearns CEO ALAN ‘ACE’ GREENBERG brought him on as money manager in 1976 and JE worked at Bear Stearns where he met LES WEXNER and became his money manager. Was at BS for six years until 1981 he left under mysterious circumstances surrounding an insider trading issue during merger talks between Seagrams and St. Joe Mineral. It appears JE was unhappy with Bear Stearns management after being fined for making an improper loan and losing his chance to be partner but prosecuting attorneys hint at something more sinister. After leaving Bear Stearns Epstein started International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.) out of his apartment on East 66th St in1982. Also in 1982, MICHAEL STROLL, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed against Epstein that shows I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which Epstein put into oil. Stroll was never re-paid and lost the suit (Michael R. Stroll v. Jeffrey Epstein ). Epstein claimed the money was for a horse he’d bought from Stroll. In the early 80’s JE met STEVEN HOFFENBERG in London. In 1987 Hoffenberg and Epstein partnered up. One of Epstein’s first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over Pan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988\. He sued the man who in 1990 sold him his multimillion-dollar Palm Beach home over a dispute about less than $16,000 in furnishings. In 1991, Wexner made Epstein trustee of the Ohio Higher Education Trust, a philanthropic fund endowed with $230 million. Epstein also served as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation and Wexner Heritage Foundation, charities that support Jewish causes in Israel and North America. Bought a plane in 1991 a Hawker and then later a Gulfstream along with a Boeing 727 (N908JE) plus a helicopter. In 1992 Office of Foreign Missions ("OFM") let a building it at 34 East 69th Street it had seized from Iran to JE. He stayed there until 1996 before he vacated and sublet the apartment illegally for a profit. He claims he was told by ROBERT MASSEY (OFM) he had permission. Through XENOPHON A. GALINAS the case goes to court In 1996 JE moved out of the rented E 69th St. home and began subleasing it to IVAN S. FISHER at $5k/month profit, the feds sued him (US v. Jeffrey E. Epstein, Ivan S. Fisher, et al). In 1993 he bought Zorro Ranch in New Mexico from BRUCE KING with Zorro Development Corp. Epstein met Clinton as early as 1995, when he paid tens of thousands of dollars to join him at an intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm Beach. But from all appearances, they did not become close friends until after Clinton left the Oval Office and moved to New York. In 1995 joined board of Rockefeller University with Kissinger’s wife. Sometime in 1998-1999 he bought the island of Little St. James. In 2000 he purchased 34 foot JVC Powerboat. Jan 5 2001 he filed a claim in civil court to lower the tax on his NM property (Zorro Trust vs The County of Santa Fe). Traveled in 2001 with PRINCE ANDREW to Thailand. In 2003 donated $30 million to Harvard University science research and made a bid to buy NY Magazine . In 2004 he financed a relaunch of Radar.com. In 2004 he bid on residential estate at 513 N. Country Road in Palm Beach but was outbid by DONALD TRUMP. In 2004 JE, d/b/a Financial Trust Co of St. Thomas, VI, sues Citibank. (Financial Trust Company, Inc. and Jeffrey E. Epstein v. Citibank, N.A. et al ). In March 2005 Palm Beach Police first start investigating Epstein based on a call from an upset parent. The investigation ultimately led to the execution of a search warrant in October 2005\. In 2006, the PB police alerted the FBI who began to investigate JE. Spring 2007 Epstein’s lawyers request a “global" solution and begin to negotiate JE’s Non-Prosecution agreement (NPA). The NPA guarantees that the federal government will not prosecute him. The NPA also grants immunity to all JE’s alleged co-conspirators. In exchange, JE must consent to allow his forty or so underage victims (who have all been acknowledged as victims by the US gov’t) to seek claims for damages from Epstein just as if, in fact, he had been tried and convicted in federal court. Additionally, the NPA said JE must offer to pay all plaintiff’s attorney’s fees but must be allowed to choose which attorneys the plaintiffs will use. Plaintiffs are allowed to use non-JE lawyers but then they must cover the cost themselves. On April 14 2008 the law firm Herman and Mermelstein filed the first civil action  
against Epstein on behalf of one of its seven clients who were molested by Epstein. JE enters a guilty plea for one count of ‘procuring a minor for prostitution’ and ‘soliciting prostitution’. He begins serving his sentence on July 1 2008\. JE registers as a Level 3 sex offender. He served 13 months of an 18-month state sentence in a vacant wing at the Palm Beach County  
Stockade where he is allowed to go to “work” from 8am-8pm 6 days/week. This is followed by house arrest. August 12 2008, attorney BRADLEY J. EDWARDS files a civil suit on behalf of Jane Doe which includes a RICO count alleging Epstein ran a criminal conspiracy to procure young girls for him and his friends to sexually abuse. Over the next year and a half,  
more than 20 other civil actions were filed against Epstein. In addition, JE settled with 15 other underage girls before their cases came to court. In 2008, his company, Zorro Trust, won over $29 million in the Oklahoma state lottery. He was deposed on May 7 2009 for Jane Doe II (Dianya Nida) v. Epstein and Kellen and defense lawyers had access to his NPA.  
He was deposed on October 8 2009 (for B.B. v. Epstein) He was deposed on Feb 17 2010\. On March 8 and 9 2010 he was deposed again for a lawsuit he filed against BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and SCOTT ROTHSTEIN. He was deposed again on April 14 2010\. He completed his sentence on July 21 2010\. JE trades his time between Paris; Palm Beach, Florida; rural New Mexico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Her father died 5 Nov 1991 and it was rumored she was destitute. she moved to NYC  
in 1992 where she met Epstein. According to defense attorneys, she was intimately involved in all of JE’s crimes. She herself seemed addicted or obsessed with having sex with young girls. She had been helping JE scout and procure girls since the mid nineties. It is alleged that JE and BILL CLINTON met through who is friends with Clinton’s assistant, DOUG BANDS. She made a public statement about the accusations against her saying it was ‘all lies’. In response, Virginia Roberts Guiffre sued her for defamation and the suit is still ongoing. Ghislaine was  
first served for deposition Sep 21 2009 but failed to appear. At the time she was represented by Brett Jaffe of the firm Cohen and Gresser Her deposition was rescheduled for June 30, 2010 but the day before she was due to appear, Maxwell’s lawyer told the defense that Maxwell, who is a UK citizen, was flying to England to attend to her mother who had become ill and she had no intention of returning to the US. But, on July 31, 2010 she was captured in a photograph taken for OK magazine while attending CHELSEA CLINTON’s wedding in Rhinebeck NY.

Jean-Luc Brunel (JLB) JE co-conspirator-brother ARNAUD BRUNEL. In 1976 JLB began his career in Paris working at Karin Models. Later, Brunel purchased it from the original owner. In 2005 Karin Models of America became MC2 Model Management in New York and Miami. Models Aline Weber and Ginta Lapina have gone on to successful modeling careers. Also  
Rebecca Romign-Stamos and Estella Warren. In 1988, 60 Minutes interviewed over a dozen models who said they had been sexually assaulted by Karin’s Paris agency owner Jean-Luc Brunel and fellow agent Claude Haddad (Dec. 18, 1988, American Models in Paris featuring Claude Haddad and Jeanluc Brunelle). In 1988, when powerhouse agency Next opened its doors, Brunel then went on to take part in the launch of Next Model Management and  
remained a partner in the company until April 1995 when he established Karin Models in New York and Miami. He also "discovered" Christy Turlington when she was 14\. The 2001 book, “Bad and Beautiful: Inside the Dazzling and Deadly World of Supermodels”, by Ian Halperin, in Chapter 26, called Straight, No Chaser, goes into great detail about the 60 Minutes interview and Brunel's horrible activities, as well as those of Claude Haddad. In 2005 Brunel  
received $1 million line of credit from Epstein to establish the modeling agency MC2 along with JEFFREY FULLER. Brunel is a French citizen but lives mostly in the US to avoid paying taxes. He avoided all summons to appear in court. Brunel visited Epstein on approximately 67 occasions while Epstein was in jail. In 2010, the Daily Beast reported a complaint filed by an alleged victim to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida stating that Jeffery Epstein, Jean-Luc Brunel and several others “deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.” 

Scouting I International Co. filed in the State of Florida is no longer active. This corporate entity was filed January 13, 2011\. Because no criminal charges were ever filed by any of his accusers, and because the industry has a short memory Brunel has been free to continue as he pleases. In 2015 JLB filed a lawsuit against JE for damages to his reputation that hurt his business (Brunel vs Epstein) Residence: 1674 Alton Road Miami Beach, FL Today, Mr. Brunel owns an 85 percent stake in New York/Miami/Tel Aviv-based agency MC2, a mid-list agency with worldwide branches that have or represent models such as Ginta Lapina, Liu Dan, Sessilee Lopez, Anastasia Lagune, Eve Doll and Alina Olegnova.

Robert Maxwell b 1923 d 1991 (media mogul, British PM, polymath) born Jan Ludvik Binyamin Hoch from Czechoslovakia. A/k/a: Ian Robert Maxwell, Jan Ludwig Hoch, Captain  
Maxwell, Wallace Chesterton, Enian Robert Maxwell, IS-R and GE. A despot in his private  
domain, belittling his wife and lashing his children with tongue and belt. He flees mainland  
Europe to escape the Nazi's and in May 1940 he arrives in Liverpool by way of a ship from  
Marseille. Met his future wife in Paris in 1944 and changed his name before he got married.  
Fought in the war and was made captain in 1945 and was awarded the Military Cross for  
bravery. In 1947 at the end of the war he was in Berlin. After the war, he was financed by  
Hambro’s Bank London. According to Robert Hallandale in a 1954 FBI interview, Maxwell’s  
contact with Herr Springer of Heidelberg from a well known publishing family provided  
entry into publishing business. In May 1951 he bought Butterworth’s and changed its name  
to Pergamon Press a scientific journal with a German bent. Controlled companies Lange  
Maxwell & Springer Inc and Simpkin Marshall. He leases Headington Heill Hall in 1959\. In  
1964 he was elected to Parliament. In 1968 he and Rupert Murdoch battled over News of  
the World and The Sun Maxwell lost both. In 1969 he attempts a partnership with Saul  
Sternberg of Leasco who leased computers but Leasco was nervous about Pergamon  
finances and a Board of Trade inquiry was launched and Price Waterhouse began an audit.  
In February 1981 he took over British Printing and Communications Corporation (BPCC), In  
1984 he takes over Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror. In 1987 bought Macmillan Publishers  
and changes BPCC to MCC (Maxwell Communications Corporation) In 1991 he makes a bid  
for Daily News. March 1991 he sells Pergamon for $500 million. In July 1991 when he was  
68 Maxwell disappears off the Canary Islands having capsized off his yacht The Lady  
Ghislaine. The circumstances of his death remain a mystery. He was buried in Israel. During  
Conchita Sarnoff's investigation a former Mossad agent suggests to her that the Mossad  
killed Maxwell. In November 1991 auditors discovered that about $ 670 million was missing  
from the Maxwell companies' pension funds. All but some $ 50 million were recovered,  
mostly through settlements among the funds and Maxwell companies, their auditors and  
financial advisers, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman, Sachs, and Coopers & Lybrand, the  
very same financial institutions that later came to the brother’s rescue. In 1995 a trial is held  
for his sons Ian and Kevin Maxwell liable for the pension funds of thousands of employees  
that he had illegally used as security against other businesses. In 1996, after an eight months  
trial, Kevin and Ian Maxwell were acquitted on charges of fraud. Three financial institutions:  
Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, and Coopers & Lybrand, interceded on their behalf in an  
effort to rescue them and their partner, the American financial advisor, Larry Trachtenberg.  
Maxwell bought the famous Lady Ghislaine yacht from the brother of Adnan Khashoggi, the well- known international arms dealer.

Leslie H. “Les” Wexner b 1937 (close friend & mentor to JE who managed Wexner’s money) Wexner was born to Russian Jewish immigrants in Dayton, Ohio. Wexner wanted to study architecture, but he bowed to his father's wishes and majored in business administration at Ohio State University. In 1963, Wexner was loaned $5,000 from his aunt to start The Limited, so named because the store focused on a limited amount of merchandise that turned over quickly and had a higher profit margin, unlike his parent's store. In the late sixties he found a mentor, A. Alfred Taubman, a Detroit real estate baron. Over the years he built a retailing and marketing conglomerate, which currently includes: Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, Henri Bendel, Lane Bryant, Abercrombie & Fitch, Lerner New York, The Limited Too The Limited, and Express. All through the years, Wexner has sought to create strong emotional ties between workers and management. Around corporate headquarters he is known to one and all as ''Les.'' In the company lexicon, employees are ''associates.'' Wexner takes paternalistic pride in having given them ''the opportunity to succeed.'' There is much talk of teamwork, of the importance of  
maintaining a family atmosphere of bonding. Some critics say The Limited is more a corporate cult than a culture, that conformity is as important as creativity. ''It's an enveloping world,'' says a buyer for another chain, who resisted The Limited's efforts to recruit her. ''If you sign up, you're owned. A lot of those people are like Moonies.’' Has a relationship with Ariel Sharon and does business in Israel. Is a major philanthropist and many contributions, like a program to train Jewish leaders, have been made through the Wexner Foundation. In 1978, Wexner bought Mast Industries to tap its Far East savvy. In January 1978, The Limited borrowed $30.9 million to acquire Mast Industries, its global production arm; at the same time, the company installed a computer network and built a vast distribution center in Columbus. When sales suddenly slumped, inventories piled up and the cash flow slowed dramatically. Wexner  
halted his expansion program and tightened operations. By January 1981, long-term debt was whittled down to $16.6 million.Limited Inc. Chairman Leslie Wexner sold a big block of stock in March. At least, it would seem like a big block to most people. Wexner sold 314,900 Limited shares on March 5 for $48.48 each, or $15.3 million. But for Wexner, that's a minor portfolio adjustment. He still holds 49.54 million shares worth $2.1 billion at $41 7/8 Friday. So Wexner's $15.3 million stock sale is the same as someone with a net worth of $100,000 selling $738 worth of stock-about 17 1/2 shares of Limited, for example. Another seller: Martin Trust, chief of Limited's highly regarded overseas clothes-buying wing, sold 200,000 shares in March for $45.95 each, or $9.2 million. He holds 4.76 million shares worth $199 million Wexner has owned the mid-18th century Foxcote House in Warwickshire, England, since 1997\. Allegedly fired JE in 2005 after start of PB investigation and replaced him with DENNIS HERSCH. Ties to  
the mob and to the murder of Arthur Shapiro in 1985\. Has a younger sister, Susan. On January 23, 1993, Wexner, then 55 years of age, married Abigail S. Koppel, 31, a lawyer. They have four: Harry, Hannah, David, and Sarah. Residence New Albany, Ohio.

Victims/procurers:  
Virginia Louise Roberts Giuffre JE victim. Was sexually abused at 13 by 67 year old man named Ron Eppinger (who knows JE) who she stayed with for 6 months. At 14 years old she had a part time job at Mar-a-Lago in 1999 (her father, Sky William Roberts was a maintenance manager there) when Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her to work for Epstein. Roberts lived as JE's ‘sex slave’ until 2002 when she fled and eventually settled in Australia. Says GM and JE had sex with her on her 16th birthday. After getting married and having no contact with JE or his posse for years, in 2007 she was contacted by JE’s people about the Palm Beach Police investigation. She told JE she would keep quiet about JE and she did so. On September 3 2008, while living in Australia, she received her victim notification and contacted the Podhurst Orseck firm to file a civil suit on September 9 2008 her attorney, Robert Josephsberg, filed a suit against JE (Jane Doe 2 v Epstein). Her lawyers settled with Epstein out of court. In 2011 Roberts was contacted by a journalist and soon sold her story to the Daily Mail who published parts of it. In March 2011 after the story came out, Roberts was contacted by AUSA MARIE VILLAFAÑA who expressed interest in her case. Soon after she was contacted by the FBI who interviewed her at length. Later that year she was contacted by attorney Brad Edwards who was being sued by Epstein (Epstein v Scott Rothstein and Bradley J Edwards ) and tells him she was abused by Prince Andrew, Ghislaine Maxwell, Jean-Luc Brunel, Alan Dershowitz, and other powerful people. In October 2013 Roberts returned to the US. In April 2014 Roberts sought, through attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell to join the federal case (Jane Doe \#1 and Jane Doe \#2 et al. v. US ). On August 20, 2014, Edwards sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Wilfredo Ferrer requesting the Government’s consent to a stipulated motion to simply add Roberts into the case as Jane Doe \#3 (as had been done earlier with Jane Doe No. 2). Edwards attached a proposed motion that did not include any of the facts surrounding her abuse. After three months with no response from Ferrer, Edwards wrote again to the US Attorney but this time gave a deadline of December 10 2014 for Ferrer to grant the stipulation. Finally, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was seeking more time, indicating that the Government understood that victims’ counsel might need to file a motion with the court on the matter immediately: “The U.S. Attorney is on travel and I do not have an answer for you on whether the government will agree to the addition of two new petitioners. I appreciate you not filing your motion until December 15, 2014\. If you need to file the motion, we understand. Thanks.” Finally, on December 23, 2014 –the Government tersely indicated its objection to adding Roberts to the federal case, without indicating any reason: “Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this stage of the litigation.” On December 30, 2014 Edwards and Cassell file a joinder motion and case briefly cited in the public filing Roberts had been victimized by ALAN DERSHOWITZ and PRINCE ANDREW among others. These two were not named randomly: Dershowitz was named because he was an attorney who helped draft the NPA and Prince Andrew was named because a sex act with him in London affected “foreign commerce”. On January 5 2015 Dershowitz made a motion to intervene and have Roberts’ remarks about him stricken from the record. Dershowitz goes on a media blitz to defend himself, calling Roberts a “serial liar” who "has lied through her teeth about many world leaders”. Prince Andrew’s spokesperson denied Roberts’ allegations, without providing any explanation for a photo that showed the Prince with Roberts while she was a minor late at night in a private setting. On Jan 14 2015, Edwards’ attorney, JACK SCAROLA sent Prince Andrew a certified letter requesting his voluntary cooperation in answering questions about his sexual interactions with VA Roberts. The letter was refused by the recipient. In December 2014 Roberts incorporated a non-profit in Florida called “Victims Refuse Silence” In February 2015 Alan Dershowitz attempted again to sanction Roberts’ testimony. September 21 2015 Roberts sued Ghislaine Maxwell for slander: Virginia L Giuffre vs. Ghislaine Maxwell . During his 2015 deposition, Alan Dershowitz implies Roberts had sex with BILL CLINTON even though Roberts makes a point in her deposition of saying she never participated or saw Clinton have sexual contact with anyone.

Johanna Sjoberg a young girlfriend/masseuse of JE’s who was of consenting age during her relationship with Epstein. According to Sjoberg’s affidavit, “It was Easter 2001, when I first met Prince Andrew.” Maxwell and another victim, Virginia Louise Roberts were there, in addition to a couple of other underage girls unnamed in the deposition.” She told her story to the press and claimed that Prince Andrew groped her breast. The article, “Prince Andrew’s Friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, Some Underage Girls and A Very Disturbing Story” broke on September 23, 2007 

L.M. aka Jane Doe \#1 Born 1988 Between approximately August 2002, when she was 13 years old and September 2005, Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted L.M. more than 50 times. She was also abused by Alan Dershowitz. Was pregnant at 16 JE bought everything on her registry and had the gifts delivered to the trailer home in which she lived. After pressing charges against JE with Palm Beach police, she gets her victims’ notification letter from the FBI (one on January 10, 2008 and then another on May 30 2008\) advising her of her rights as a victim and advising the case against JE was still ongoing. L.M. retains Attorney Bradley J. Edwards to defend her in her civil action against JE (L.M. v. Jeffrey Epstein ) Award 15 million When LM and her attorneys finally heard the terms of JE’s sweetheart deal the are outraged and on July 7 2008 L.M. hires Edwards to represent her in a federal suit claiming her rights as a victim had been violated by the terms of JE’s NPA. Over the next several years, the Government took conflicting positions on whether it would stipulate to facts provided by L.M. (and later Jane Doe \# 2). On December 7, 2009, Jeffrey Epstein filed a lawsuit against L.M. and Attorney Edwards, alleging that they had manufactured claims and had sensationalized the allegations against him. Epstein also alleged that Attorney Scott Rothstein had engaged in a fraud against him. (Jeffrey Epstein v. Scott Rothstein, Bradley J. Edwards, and L.M. ) In 2011 on behalf of his clients, Edwards filed a summary judgment motion alleging 53 proposed undisputed facts, along with a motion to have the Court accept those facts in light of the Government’s failure thus far to contest them. The case is ongoing.

Jeffrey Fuller ran MC Square is allegedly gay KARIN MODELS “Saying that Karin Models Miami Director Jeff Fuller has a cocaine problem is like saying Elite head pervert John Casablancas likes em a little young. Jeff is well known on the Miami party circuit with his way too unbuttoned silk shirts, dropping names and giving air kisses to anyone and everyone who will listen. But its at the midnight hour that he becomes the life of the party. With his little eight balls, he is the king of coke. How do you think Karins Models stay so thin, darling? Well known among Miami bookers and some models, Jeff”s coke habit has kept him from moving to New York or Paris where there is 12 months of work, not 8 or 9 like in Miami” Business Address: 6 W.14th Street

Manager’ at Financial Trust Company, his offshore company, while she worked simultaneously as a board member at the Antilles School on St. Thomas. Apparently, it is strange if not unprincipled that Mrs. De Jongh did not notify the private school and parents in light of the fiduciary and ethical responsibilities. Given her close association with Epstein and the laws governing the proximity between a predator and school aged children, it might have made sense to at least notify the school board of their professional relationship. As it happens, Mrs. De Jongh was the first wife of a sitting governor in the United States to be employed by a convicted sex offender. In January 2016, Cecile de Jongh, no longer first lady, remains in her employ as Epstein’s office manager. 2

the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. In 2005, when the Palm Beach Police Department was first investigating Epstein’s sexual abuse, it interviewed more than a dozen minor girls. Coincidentally and remarkably, it was Dershowitz who personally collected and then provided flight manifests of the “Lolita Express” to the Palm Beach Police Department. See, e.g., Police Detective Joe Recarey Depo. at 281, Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM (Mar. 19, 2010\) In 2007 he helped broker JE’s NPA that contained a sweeping provision that provided immunity in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to ‘”any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.”. In August 2011 he was contacted by the defense and was requested to cooperate and answer questions about various cases. He was warned by the lawyers they would be forced to disclose the reasons publicly but Dershowitz refused to cooperate. On December 30, 2014 Edwards and Cassell file a joinder motion wanting to add VA Roberts to their case and that references Roberts’ complaints against Dershowitz and on December 31 2014 Politico reports on the story. Dershowitz embarks on a media campaign to defend himself-he calls Roberts a “serial perjurer, serial liar & serial prostitute”. He also accuses her attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, are unethical and claims he will file disbarment charges against them He also says he had no involvement in JE’s NPA and that he had never visited JE's island without his family present. He also says he knows that Roberts is lying because she's claimed she had sex with Bill Clinton on JE's island and Dershowitz swears Clinton never set foot on the island. On January 3 2015 Jack Scarola, the attorney  
representing Edwards and Cassell, invites Dershowitz to cooperate but Dershowitz doesn’t respond. On January 5 2015 Dershowitz makes a motion to intervene on the federal case (Jane Doe \#1, et al. v. United States Case No. 08-cv-80736 ) to strike a proffer made by VA Roberts (Jane Doe \#3) of facts that support her pending motion to join this action that mention Dershowitz. On January 6 2015 Edwards and Cassell file a defamation suit against Dershowitz (Edwards and Cassell vs Dershowitz CACE 15-000072) On Feb 25 2015 Jack Scarola, the attorney representing Edwards and Cassell, sent a friendly letter to Dershowitz attorney complaining of Dershowitz's refusal to cooperate and his improper conduct.

Donald Hafele Palm Beach County Circuit Judge (ruled allowing subpoenaed JE’s victim’ abortion records but in 2009 ordered Epstein's erect member couldn’t be examined for a civil lawsuit that was filed against him by the women he abused.) in 2014 sided with JE over victims’ attorney Brad Edwards, ruling there is no legal basis for Edwards’ claims of abuse of process and malicious prosecution. The ruling stemmed from a civil lawsuit that JE filed in 2009 against Edwards, claiming that Edwards used the judicial system improperly in investigating Epstein for civil lawsuits that Edwards filed on behalf of the victims. JE dropped his lawsuit against Edwards in August 2012\. But Edwards forged on with his counterclaim, saying Epstein filed his “baseless and unsupportable claims” to get Edwards to back down from representing victims and force him to spend time, energy and resources on his own defense. 

Jay Lefkowitz (Attorney who helped negotiate JE’s NPA with Kenneth Starr in 2007\) His father, Jerome, a labor lawyer drafted New York’s landmark Taylor Law.

Reinhart moved to intervene in federal case to contest the victims’ allegations that Reinhart (a former prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigating Epstein) received confidential, non-public information about the investigation. The victims specifically alleged that Reinhart had “joined Epstein’s payroll shortly after important decisions were made limiting Epstein’s criminal liability” and that Reinhart had gone on to improperly represent Epstein-related witnesses in various civil suits. Reinhart filed a sworn affidavit admitting that he had represented Epstein-related clients, but claiming that he did not possess any such confidential information. He sought to intervene to challenge the victims’ arguments but was denied by the Court. He visited Epstein in prison July 2 2008 August 8 2008

AUSA Villafaña did not advise that a plea agreement had already been negotiated with Epstein’s attorneys that would block federal prosecution. To the contrary, AUSA Villafaña mentioned a possible indictment. AUSA Villafaña did indicate that federal investigators had concrete evidence and information that Epstein had sexually molested many underage minor females. Edwards also requested from the U.S. Attorney’s Office the information that they had collected regarding Epstein’s sexual abuse of his clients. However, the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to provide any such information to Edwards. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA Villafafia received a copy of Epstein’s proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008\.

MOSSADS “Clothing Shop Network (Магазин/одежды/בגדים חנות) ”, this report explains, was originated in the early 1980’s by one of the most secretive billionaires in American named Leslie Wexner, and whose father (Harry Wexner—changed from Hagan Wexelstein) emigrated to the United States in the late 1930’s from the Jewish Autonomous Oblast (former Soviet Union). 

The “Clothing Shop Network” name itself, this report continues, was derived from Leslie Wexner being one of America’s top clothiers—and who owns the US-based fashion retailers L Brands and Victoria’s Secret. 

In 1982, SVR intelligence analysts in this report detail, Wexner recruited Jeffery Epstein into the “Clothing Shop Network” by providing him with an estimated $1 billion to establish a private financial firm named J. Epstein & Company—and that Wexner remains the firm’s biggest and the only publicly known client of.

Ralph Cioffi & Matthew Tannin In its fraud indictment of former Bear Stearns managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tanin – accused of misleading investors about the risky subprime mortgage market – the feds identify one victim as “Major Investor No. 1,” who lost about $57 million. That investor was Epstein, according to sources. The arrests came on June 19, 2008, when two Bear Stearns hedge fund directors, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, were charged with securities fraud. The strange thing is that Epstein had never met Cioffi or Tannin. Cioffi’s email sent to me on November 17, 2014 explained, “I never knew Epstein at Bear. Never met him while he was an employee or even as an investor in the fund.” The case brought by the Justice Department sought to prove that Cioffi and Tannin deceived their investors, including Epstein. According to several reports the case was weak and hinged on a couple of e-mails that were taken out of context. Nevertheless, Cioffi and Tannin were charged with securities fraud and Bank of America subsequently filed a Complaint against the two men. After their arrests, The New York Times reported, they “were among the few executives to face a trial on criminal charges in the aftermath of the financial crisis… The bank accused the two men of lying about the health of their hedge funds, which had invested heavily in subprime mortgage-backed securities that plummeted in value when the housing market collapsed.” Judge Alison J. Nathan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, “rejected Bank of America’s claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, ruling that bank had failed to prove damages tied to the conduct of the two men.” 7 Conceivably by professing to give the government inside information such as the internal workings of Bear Stearns and the structured funds, Epstein and his attorneys were able to negotiate a better plea deal with the Department of Justice in return for lesser charges and less jail time. Perhaps Epstein realized during the beginning of the negotiations, that he was able to strike back against the firm who fired him at their most vulnerable. Two years after Epstein’s sentencing, in 2009, Cioffi and Tannin were found not guilty and their cases were acquitted. The November 11, 2009 New York Times story claimed the jury had reasonable doubt on every count filed against them. I spoke with Ralph Cioffi on a number of occasions about his case. Later, on November 17, 2014, Cioffi explained, “I do not know why Epstein was fired from Bear Stearns and doubt Matt would. I never knew Epstein at Bear. Never met him while he was an employee or even as an investor in the fund.” By early January of the following year, 2015, Cioffi warned me, “Epstein is an evil person. Makes the ‘root of all evil is money’ phrase ring true. With Epstein, there were always rumors about what went on, on his jet when flying back and forth from Europe,” Cioffi said. 8 Sarnoff, Conchita (2016-07-06). TrafficKing (Kindle Locations 2397-2412).

Dalton has gone through many changes in the past year. When Mr. Barr left last June, Peter Branch was called upon to fill his place. As acting headmaster, Mr. Branch made himself available to the student body and worked hard to improve  
student and faculty-administration relations. A more positive and concerned community has been the result. Although Dr. Dunnan has only been a part of our school for six months, he has already gained the respect and affection of all. He has continued Mr. Branch’s beneficial policies and has brought us some innovative and promising ideas of his own.  
We welcome Dr. Dunnan to Dalton; we should certainly thrive under his leadership.

She was a well-educated, sheltered Frenchwoman of impeccable Huguenot lineage. His widow says in 1995 What she has to show for her efforts is spectacular ruin; debt, dishonor and the potential destruction of two sons' careers. She says the financial losses she has sustained since her husband's death, including her own pension and the auction of her Oxford home and personal belongings, weigh on her far less.

Model Alina Pascau has been flashing a massive canary-yellow diamond engagement ring Ratner recently gave her, we're told. Pascau, a Romanian stunner, used to date reclusive billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, who handles Leslie Wexner's fortune, helped land her a gig modeling for Wexner's Victoria's Secret brand, we hear, and paid for her to live in high style. After they broke up she and Ratner dated for a while before his fling with Williams. "She's beautiful, but dumb as paint," one pal of Pascau told us. "She never washes her hair and she always has a cellphone glued to her ear. Without Jeffrey she would never have gotten the Victoria's Secret job."

Lewex Inc., an investment company owned solely by Limited Inc. Chairman Leslie Wexner, failed to reach an agreement to sell its majority interest in Omni Exploration Inc. 

But most of the shares were sold  by the Ohio Higher Education Trust, the entity Wexner created early 1991 and funded with 10 million shares of Limited stock, then worth about $250 million. 

Multi-Group To implement Neva, Maxwell created a bunch of companies, such as Multiart (for producing stolen technology for the metal industry), Balkan Films (for providing stolen technology from Hollywood to the Bulgarian film industry), Stanke Dimitrov (for software to the pharmaceutical industry), Sophia Insurance (computers for the office management sector), and so on. The many companies provided cover for the Mossad operatives to infiltrate the Eastern Bloc. The companies eventually would be grouped under Maxwells Multi-Group (Multigroup) and embraced by the Russian and Bulgarian mafia. 

Mast Industries based in Andover MA. In 1978, Wexner took on a big slug of debt to buy Mast Industries, an importer and contract manufacturer. Mast, whose president and founder is MARTIN TRUST, has interests in a dozen factories in Asia and longstanding relationships with 190 others around the world. It also coordinates global transport. ''Mast is The Limited's trump card,'' says the president of a competing specialty chain. ''It's light-years ahead in terms of understanding how to get things done in the Far East.’' 

If fabric must be moved from China to Korea, a Mast employee is on hand to get the cloth through customs. If Columbus is desperate for a shipment of pants, a Mast executive in Hong Kong gets them on the next plane out; The Limited's merchandise fills an average of three United States-bound 747's a week. 

After clearing customs, the goods are transferred to a fleet of tractor-trailers, owned by The Limited and operated by Walsh Trucking, a New Jersey-based company, and rushed to the distribution center in Ohio. The journey from the Far East to Columbus has taken six days, too many for Wexner. He wants an airfield south of Columbus designated an international port of entry, which would cut that time in half. In 1990 Mast is the design and procurement arm of Limited and is working with Sony Corporation of America, of New York, and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. of Atlanta on an HDTV system for retailing. Mast Industries, the manufacturing division, currently produces only about half of The Limited divisions' clothing, but it is playing an increasing role in getting newly acquired companies off and running.

Richard Axle (JE was asked out him in deposition) During the late 1970s, Axel, along with microbiologist Saul J. Silverstein and geneticist Michael H. Wigler, discovered a technique of cotransformation, a process which allows foreign DNA to be inserted into a host cell to produce certain proteins. Patents, now colloquially referred to as the "Axel patents", covering this technique were filed for February 1980 and were issued in August 1983\. As a fundamental process in recombinant DNA research as performed at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, this patent proved quite lucrative for Columbia University, earning it almost $100 million a year at one time, and a top spot on the list of top universities by licensing revenue. The Axel patents expired in August 2000\.

Nick Leese 

Max M. Fisher (1908-2005) Born in Pittsburgh, died in Detroit The Wall Street Journal identified him as a Detroit financier billionaire, and as a member of the Mega Group. Was used as a private Middle East diplomat by President Gerald Ford during the 1970s and is considered Leslie Wexner’s mentor. His family follows in the footsteps of his great Zionist heritage and his daughter, Jane Sherman, is an eminently active member of the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors, a generous donor, and heads the United Israel Appeal today. 

Mega Group was launched in 1991 by Seagrams Corp. director Charles Bronfman and Victoria's Secret owner Leslie Wexner. KOPPEL--Yehuda. The Hillel family notes with sadness the passing of Yehuda Koppel of New York City. We are forever indebted to proud Zionists like Mr. Koppel who believed in, and risked their life for, the creation of the State of Israel. The seeds he planted allowed Israel to grow and  flourish. We extend our deepest sympathies to his daughter, Abigail Koppel Wexner, and sonin-law, Leslie H. Wexner, and to the entire Koppel family. May the marvelous legacy he left for the Jewish people give them comfort at this difficult time. Edgar M. Bronfman, Lynn Schusterman, Michael Steinhardt, Hillel International Board of Governors KOPPEL--Yehuda. September 25, 2006 in New York. Mr. Koppel, 89, was born in Kalish, Poland to Chaim and Sara Koppel. He left Poland at the age of 16 and resettled in Palestine. Mr. Koppel joined the British Army and was a member of the Jewish Brigade. He fought in WW II in Europe and retired from the British Army with the rank of Major. Mr. Koppel played an important role in the founding of the State of Israel as a leader in the Haganah. In the 1950's, he moved to New York where he opened the first American office of El Al, Israel's national airline, and where he lived until his death. Mr. Koppel was an avid reader of history and the classics, fluent in multiple languages, and a life master tournament bridge player. His love of family gave great meaning and joy to his life. He is survived by his wife, Zipora Goldman Koppel; sons Dan Koppel and Gil Koppel, daughter Abigail Koppel Wexner and son-in-law Leslie H. Wexner; & grandchildren Lee Koppel & Harry, Hannah, David, and Sarah Wexner. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to ''Friends of the Israel Defense Forces,'' 350 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2011, New York, New York 10118\. A private funeral service will be held in Israel. 

The arrangement is just one reason people envy and disapprove of Goga Ashkenazi — along with her money and her background. 

It was 5ft 10in tall Goga who introduced her friend Prince Andrew to another friend, Kazakh oil and banking billionaire Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of the President of Kazakhstan. 

The back-story is well-known: divorced Andrew had failed for several years to sell Sunninghill for the £12 million asking price and was prepared to take less. Along comes Timur, the kingpin in Kazakhstan’s energy sector, calmly paying over the odds — a  whopping £15 million — for the white elephant. We’ve never been told why. 

Nicholas Davies, also known as Nick Davies, is a journalist and author, formerly foreign editor of the Daily Mirror. He was closely associated with Robert Maxwell, and was the centre of considerable UK media attention in 1991 after he was accused in Seymour Hersh's book The Samson Option of involvement in Israeli arms deals and of passing the location of Mordechai Vanunu to Mossad. In response, Maxwell and Davies sued for libel, although Davies did not pursue the case and Mirror Group apologised and settled on behalf of Maxwell after his death. joined Mirror Group Newspapers in 1961 as a foreign correspondent and investigative reporter. He served as foreign editor of the Daily Mirror for 14 years until he was sacked by Maxwell in 1991 at the age of 52\. Davies later went on to publish stories of working with Maxwell. Davies was named by Ari Ben-Menashe as his business partner in Profits of War, in relation to Iran- Contra and the sale of PROMIS, the first computer spyware. The arrangement was also noted in the book Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul by Gordon Thomas. Ben-Menashe later posted seven documents relating to sales of arms by Davies, sometimes signing himself  a Davis. Ben-Menashe also claimed Davies was a "major player" in arms sales to Iran and made more than $1.5 million on one deal. He did have a close friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales.\[citation needed\] 

From 1982 to 1991, he was married to the Australian actress Janet Fielding this time he had three children. Davies stayed at The Observer for a couple of years before becoming chief feature writer of the London Daily News (LDN) in 1987\. “So I took my partner and my two-year-old daughter off to Washington to work as a freelance – just because it would be an exciting adventure.” When he returned to the UK two years later, in 1989, Rusbridger had become features editor of The Guardian 

But Robert Maxwell’s attempt to launch a new London daily failed after just five months, leaving Davies out of work.There are some details of his personal life in his books The Unknown Maxwell and Death of a Tycoon: An Insider's Account of the Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell. In the last few years, he was centrally involved in the publication of secret US logs and cables obtained by Wikileaks and in exposing the phone-hacking scandal in \-Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire
