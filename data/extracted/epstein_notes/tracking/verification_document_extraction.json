On this trip, historian Andrew Lownie alleged Prince Andrew, on taxpayer-funded trade mission, 'had 40 prostitutes brought' to five-star hotel. However, explicit analysis concludes: 'The article does not state or imply that Jeffrey Epstein was present on this specific Thailand trip.' Research discusses 2001 Thailand trip by Prince Andrew involving allegations of prostitution but decouples this event from Jeffrey Epstein. Notes LINK Epstein to event. Based on provided corpus, this link is unverified and contradicted",
