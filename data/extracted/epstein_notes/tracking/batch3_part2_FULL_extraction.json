Was to deliver keynote and accept Citizen of Year award at temple festive dinner September 6 2002 but cancelled after dinner chairman Alan Burstein learned Dershowitz agreed to serve as counsel to British law firm appealing Abdelbaset al-Megrahi conviction. 2005 when Palm Beach Police investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of dozen+ minor girls, coincidentally and remarkably Dershowitz personally collected and provided flight manifests of 'Lolita Express' to PBPD. 2007 helped broker JE's NPA with sweeping immunity provision for Epstein and 'any potential co-conspirators'. August 2011 contacted by defense, requested to cooperate and answer questions, lawyers warned they'd disclose reasons publicly but Dershowitz refused to cooperate. December 30 2014 Edwards and Cassell filed joinder motion wanting to add VA Roberts to their case, references Roberts' complaints against Dershowitz. December 31 2014 Politico reports on story. Dershowitz embarked on media campaign defending himself, called Roberts 'serial perjurer, serial liar & serial prostitute', accused her attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell of being unethical, claimed he'd file disbarment charges. Also said he had no involvement in JE's NPA and never visited JE's island without family present. Says Roberts is lying because she claimed she had sex with Bill Clinton on JE's island and Dershowitz swears Clinton never set foot on island. January 3 2015 Jack Scarola (attorney representing Edwards/Cassell) invited Dershowitz to cooperate but no response. January 5 2015 Dershowitz made motion to intervene on federal case (Jane Doe #1 et al v US 08-cv-80736) to strike proffer by VA Roberts (Jane Doe #3) mentioning Dershowitz. January 6 2015 Edwards and Cassell filed defamation suit against Dershowitz (Edwards and Cassell vs Dershowitz CACE 15-000072). February 25 2015 Jack Scarola sent friendly letter to Dershowitz attorney complaining of refusal to cooperate and improper conduct. Deposed October 15 2015. During deposition disclosed confidential settlement discussion with David Boies in which Boies privately assured Dershowitz he didn't believe client Virginia Roberts' claims. December 11 2015 ignoring confidentiality agreement filed affidavit detailing discussion to court. Roberts filed motion to sanction Dershowitz. Case settled April 8 2016.",

The ruling stemmed from civil lawsuit that JE filed 2009 against Edwards, claiming Edwards used judicial system improperly in investigating Epstein for civil lawsuits Edwards filed on behalf of victims. JE dropped his lawsuit against Edwards August 2012. But Edwards forged on with his counterclaim, saying Epstein filed 'baseless and unsupportable claims' to get Edwards to back down from representing victims and force him to spend time, energy and resources on own defense.",

AUSA Villafaña did indicate that federal investigators had concrete evidence and information that Epstein had sexually molested many underage minor females. Edwards also requested from U.S. Attorney's Office information they had collected regarding Epstein's sexual abuse of his clients. However, U.S. Attorney's Office declined to provide any such information to Edwards.

AUSA Villafafia called Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding hearing. AUSA Villafafia did not tell Attorney Edwards that guilty pleas in state court would bring end to possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to plea agreement. 2017 who is now U.S. Attorney under Attorney General Eric Holder.",
